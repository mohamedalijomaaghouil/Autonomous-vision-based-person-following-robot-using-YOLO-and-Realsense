 🤖 Autonomous Vision-Based Person Following Robot Using YOLO and Realsense

This project implements a real-time person-following robot using YOLOv11 object detection and an Intel Realsense camera. It estimates the distance to a detected person and allows the robot to follow them using computer vision techniques.

 📌 Features

- Person detection with YOLOv11
- Distance estimation using focal length and bounding box
- Real-time video processing
- Easy calibration mode
- Python + OpenCV based implementation

 🚀 How It Works

1. The model detects people in each video frame.
2. Calibrates the focal length using a known distance.
3. Calculates real-time distance to each person.
4. Displays bounding boxes and distances on screen.

> 📏 Formula used:  
> `Distance = (Real Height × Focal Length) / Pixel Height`

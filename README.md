# ğŸ¤– Robot Follow Me

This project implements a vision-based person-following robot using a Realsense D435i camera and a YOLOv8 object detection model.

 ğŸ“Œ Project Summary
- Detects a person using YOLOv8 and estimates distance based on lower-body bounding box.
- Dynamically adjusts robot wheel speeds based on the measured distance.
- Designed for integration with a 4-wheeled robot platform in the ENISo lab.
- Tested with webcam during development phase.

ğŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO
- Intel Realsense D435i
- Computer Vision & Robotics
